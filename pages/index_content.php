		<p>Welcome to the Chronicler Database, the home of all of the Chronicles created by users and recorded by The Cronicler Discord Bot!</p>
		<p>If you want to read your own Chronicle, or find some by others that sound interesting to you, then look over to the left sidebar. There, you will find links to all of the publicly viewable Chronicles sorted alphabetically. If you would like to add the Chronicler to your own Discord server, then click the &quot;Get The Chronicler&quot; link at the top of the page. That will take you to the page that will show you how to get The Chronicler onto your own server.</p>
		<p>Happy Reading, and Happy Chronicling!</p>
